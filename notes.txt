The attached dataset (Voodoo_Test_Business_Case.csv) contains user data from a Voodoo game (Ball Mayhem). Data has been filtered on sessions belonging to an AB test experiment, which objective was to find the right ad frequency; various frequencies (from xxLow to xxHigh) have been tested. 

Briefly describe the data and the AB test context. 
The data consists of 18 columns and each entry belongs to one session of a user. Here is a brief explanation of each columns. 
The goal of this AB test is to find the right ad frequency from the 6 different frequencies we have tested. We want to know which one brings the most revenue from the ad as well as a longer session time before the user gets annoyed by the ads.  

What is the success metric of this test?
The success metric of this test is a higher publisher revenue as well as a longer session length

Is there a clear winner to this AB test? Why? 

What would be your business recommendation(s) to the game manager? 

Do you have any suggestions for future experiments?


Please document your answers with clear analyses and data visualizations.
